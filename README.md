# Install Chromebrew:
Thanks to the developers: https://github.com/chromebrew/chromebrew

## Prerequisites
> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware of the fact that developer mode is insecure if not properly configured.

<a id="set_passwd" /> <!-- for reference in installation section -->
> [!TIP]
> Setting a password as instructed in the VT-2 login screen is recommended. It is also recommended to enable signed boot:
>
> ```bash
> sudo chromeos-setdevpasswd
> ```
> ```bash
> sudo crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=1
> ```

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The beta, dev, and Canary channels are ***not*** supported and should ***not*** be used with Chromebrew. Failure to take notice of this warning will cause major issues with your Chromebrew installation.
>
> See issue [#2890](https://github.com/chromebrew/chromebrew/issues/2890) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/chromebrew/chromebrew/wiki/FAQ) for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> On ChromeOS M117+, the Chromebrew installer will not work in `crosh` anymore due to the security changes introduced in ChromeOS M117.

Open a VT-2 terminal session with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> and login with the `chronos` user and password if set [above](#set_passwd). *(if you are unable to do this, please have a second look at the prerequisites and make sure your Chromebook is in developer mode)*

Then run the installation script below:

```bash
bash <(curl -L git.io/vddgY) && . ~/.bashrc
```


> This is mainly to add Python support.
> Chromebrew installs Python by default during installation.

# Add python script:
## Make the root directory writable.

```bash
sudo -i
```

```bash
mount -o rw,remount /
```
## Clone Repository to home directory

```bash
cd /home/chronos/user
```

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/CJsps199/Fyde-Mac_Keyboard_Backlight.git
```

## Copy file to correct directory

```bash
cd Fyde-Mac_Keyboard_Backlight
```

```bash
cp keyboard-backlight.py /usr/local/bin
```

## Make file executable

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/keyboard-backlight.py
